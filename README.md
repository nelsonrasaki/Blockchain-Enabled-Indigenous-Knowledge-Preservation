# Blockchain-Enabled Indigenous Knowledge Preservation

A decentralized platform that empowers indigenous communities to document, protect, and selectively share their traditional knowledge while ensuring proper attribution and fair compensation when appropriate.

## Overview

This project leverages blockchain technology to address the urgent need for preserving indigenous knowledge systems that face threats from globalization, climate change, and generational disconnection. By creating a secure, community-controlled digital repository, the platform enables indigenous peoples to document their traditional practices, languages, stories, and ecological knowledge on their own terms.

The system uses smart contracts to enforce cultural protocols, manage access permissions, ensure proper attribution, and facilitate fair benefit sharing when indigenous knowledge is utilized in commercial or research applications.

## Core Components

### 1. Knowledge Registration Contract

Securely records and preserves traditional knowledge:
- Multi-format documentation (text, audio, video, imagery)
- Elder verification and community validation processes
- Contextual metadata and cultural significance
- Temporal and geographic references
- Language preservation integration
- Knowledge categorization and relationships

### 2. Access Control Contract

Manages permissions based on cultural protocols:
- Community-defined access rules and restrictions
- Seasonal/ceremonial access limitations
- Age/gender/role-based permissions
- Sacred/sensitive knowledge protection
- Graduated access levels for different user types
- Community governance of permission changes

### 3. Attribution Contract

Ensures proper credit for indigenous knowledge:
- Source community identification
- Knowledge keeper recognition
- Citation requirements enforcement
- Usage tracking and reporting
- Attribution format specifications
- Historical lineage documentation

### 4. Benefit Sharing Contract

Manages compensation for commercial applications:
- Community-determined compensation models
- Royalty distribution mechanisms
- Non-monetary benefit arrangements
- Prior informed consent verification
- Usage limitation enforcement
- Commercial vs. non-commercial distinction

## Benefits

- **For Indigenous Communities**: Preserves cultural heritage, maintains control over knowledge sharing, ensures proper attribution, and secures fair compensation
- **For Researchers**: Provides ethical access to valuable knowledge, establishes clear usage guidelines, and facilitates proper attribution
- **For Commercial Entities**: Creates transparent pathways for ethical utilization of indigenous knowledge with proper compensation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [List technical prerequisites]

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/indigenous-knowledge-preservation.git

# Install dependencies
cd indigenous-knowledge-preservation
npm install
```

### Configuration
1. Configure your blockchain connection in `config.js`
2. Set up decentralized storage connections
3. Configure community-specific parameters

### Deployment
```bash
# Compile smart contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Deploy to test network
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network testnet

# Run tests
npx hardhat test
```

## Usage Examples

### Registering Traditional Knowledge
```javascript
// Example code for knowledge registration
const knowledgeRegistry = await KnowledgeRegistry.deploy();
await knowledgeRegistry.registerKnowledge(
  communityId,
  "Traditional Medicinal Practice", // Knowledge type
  knowledgeDetailsHash, // IPFS hash of detailed documentation
  accessRestrictions, // Array of access control parameters
  requiredAttribution, // Attribution requirements
  benefitSharingTerms // Compensation terms if applicable
);
```

### Setting Cultural Access Protocols
```javascript
// Example code for setting access controls
const accessController = await AccessController.deploy();
await accessController.setAccessProtocol(
  knowledgeId,
  seasonalRestrictions,
  roleBasedPermissions,
  communityApprovalRequirement,
  externalAccessLimitations
);
```

## Community-First Design

- **Community governance**: Indigenous control over all platform decisions
- **Digital sovereignty**: Data ownership remains with knowledge originators
- **Cultural sensitivity**: Designed to respect diverse cultural protocols
- **Low-tech access options**: Multiple ways to interact with the platform
- **Oral tradition support**: Audio/video primary documentation options

## Implementation Roadmap

- **Q2 2025**: Initial platform development with pilot communities
- **Q3 2025**: Expanded documentation tools and multimedia support
- **Q4 2025**: Integration with academic/research access protocols
- **Q1 2026**: Commercial utilization framework and benefit sharing mechanisms

## Ethical Framework

- Free, prior, and informed consent at all stages
- Community ownership of all knowledge assets
- Right to remove or modify stored knowledge
- Transparency in all platform operations
- Regular community review processes

## Cultural Safety Measures

- Community-led moderation
- Culturally appropriate content warnings
- Elder verification processes
- Sacred knowledge protection protocols
- Seasonal knowledge management
